# CS464-Final-Project

I learned about OBS Studio's audio editing capabilities and was very impressed by all the options available. I made it my goal to learn more about audio editing to help those who wish to learn more about audio editing and need a good starting point to acquaint them with audio editing terminology and hopefully motivate them to research further.

- This documentation is written to be able to be a standalone knowledge base in OBS Studio's records if desired
- It is also using OBS Studio's formatting so it can seamlessly be added to existing OBS documentation. 
- This documentation is intended to be added to https://obsproject.com/kb/audio-mixer-guide if possible.
